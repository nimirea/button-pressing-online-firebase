    <h2>Key Information about this research study:</h2>

    <p>The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is explained later on in this form.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The purpose of this study is to learn more about how people learn to speak words and phrases in a new language.</li>
      <li>This research study will take place across <b>2 days</b> with a 1 hour experimental session on each day.</li>
      <li>You will be asked press a sequence of keys on the provided keyboard during each experimental session, and to wear an activity tracker on your wrist during each night of the study.</li>
      <li>The primary potential risk of participation is frustration with the button-pressing task; to counteract this, you will be able to take breaks during experimental sessions.</li>
      <li>The main benefit of being in this study is helping scientists better understand language learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</h2>
    <p>We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have responded to our screening survey indicating that you are an adult native English speaker with no history of speech, hearing, language, or sleep disorder, and that you have no history of colorblindness. In addition, you indicated that you own the equipment necessary to complete the button-pressing task, and that you would be willing to log into the study at the same time for 2 days in a row and travel to Northwestern for equipment drop-off/pick-up.</p>

    <h2>How many people will be in this study?</h2>
    <p>We expect about 130 people will be in this research study.</p>

    <h2>What should I know about participating in a research study?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Someone will explain the research study to you.</li>
      <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
      <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
      <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
      <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
      <li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
      <li>You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What happens if I say, "Yes, I want to be in this research"?</h2>

    <p>You will be asked to select when you are available to pick up and drop off the Fitbit activity tracker that you will be asked to wear on your wrist during each night of the study, as well as the keyboard that you will be asked to use to complete the study. You will also be asked a few demographic questions that will allow us to collect more accurate sleep data—these are completely optional, and you will be compensated even if you decline to answer some or all of these demographic questions.</p>
    <p>At the pick-up appointment, which should take no longer than 5 minutes, the experimenter will give you a Fitbit wearable activity tracker and a USB keyboard. They will also email you a link to the first session of the experiment.</p>
    <p>You will be asked to complete this first session on your own computer on the day that you pick up the activity tracker, so that you can complete all sessions before returning the activity tracker. These sessions should be spaced exactly 24 hours apart, and each session will take approximately 1 hour to complete.</p>

    <p>Each session will have 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You will first be asked to test out the keyboard we provided, to make sure that your hands are in the correct position.</li>
      <li>Then, you will be asked to put on headphones and press keys on the provided keyboard for about 50 minutes.</li>
      <li>Finally, you will be asked to complete a post-task survey about your equipment and your sleep habits.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After completing the post-task survey on each day, you will be asked to complete the next day’s session of this study 24 hours later, after a full night of sleep, during which you should wear the activity tracker. The next day’s session link will be emailed to you after you have completed the previous day’s session, but before 24 hours have elapsed.</p>

    <h2>Will being in this study help me in any way?</h2>
    <p>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, possible benefits include contributing to science that can help create better language-learning tools.</p>

    <h2>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</h2>

    <p>You may experience boredom and/or frustration during the button-pressing task, which is quite difficult. You will have the opportunity to take breaks during the study in order to help with this.</p>
    <p>A possible risk for any research is that confidentiality could be compromised – that is, that people outside the study might get hold of confidential study information.  We will do everything we can to minimize this risk, as described in more detail later in this form.</p>

    <h2>What happens if I do not want to be in this research, or I change my mind later?</h2>
    <p>Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate.  If you do not want to be in this study or withdraw from the study at any point, your decision will not affect your relationship with Northwestern University/Northwestern Memorial Healthcare.</p>
    <p>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.</p>
    <p>If you decide to withdraw from this study, the researchers will ask you if information already collected from you can be used.</p>

    <h2>How will the researchers protect my information?</h2>
    <p>After data collection is finished, your email address and participant ID will be stripped from your survey answers, key-press data, and sleep data, and replaced with a random number. The mapping between your email address, your participant ID, and this random number, as well as your key-press data, survey answers, and sleep data will be stored and backed up on a secure server that only project personnel, the IRB staff, and any other individual required by law will be authorized to access. The Fitbit account associated with your sleep data will not be linked to your email address, and will be deleted after data collection is complete.</p>

    <h2>Who will have access to the information collected during this research study?</h2>
    <p>Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy.</p>
    <p>There are reasons why information about you may be used or seen by other people beyond the research team during or after this study. Examples include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>University officials, government officials, study funders, auditors, and the Institutional Review Board may need access to the study information to make sure the study is done in a safe and appropriate manner.</li>
      <li>The research team may give information to appropriate authorities for reasons of health and safety – for example, if you indicate that you plan to harm yourself or others, or for public health reasons.</li>
      <li>We will not ask you about child abuse, but if you tell us about child abuse or neglect, we may be required or permitted by law or policy to report to authorities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How might the information collected in this study be shared in the future?</h2>
    <p>We will keep the information we collect about you during this research study for study recordkeeping. Your recordings, email address, and other information that can directly identify you will be stored securely and separately from the rest of the research information we collect from you.</p>
    <p>De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community, with journals in which study results are published, and with databases and data repositories used for research. We will remove or code any personal information that could directly identify you before the study data are shared. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data.</p>
    <p>The results of this study could be shared in articles and presentations, but will not include any information that identifies you unless you give permission for use of information that identifies you in articles and presentations.</p>

    <h2>Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?</h2>
    <p>You will receive up to $30 in cash for your participation in this study, distributed upon return of the study equipment. You will still receive compensation for your time even if you choose to withdraw before completing the entire {{ compensation.length }}-day study:</p>

    <ul>
      <li v-for="(item, index) in compensation" :key="item">
        You will receive<span v-if="index > 0"> an additional</span> ${{ item }} for completing completing Day {{ index + 1 }}'s session.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, you will receive reimbursement for any public transit, taxi, rideshare, or parking expenses you may incur when picking up and returning the study equipment.</p>
